## Not Only Accessible but Usable Sound Synthesizer


### Aren't There Several Sound Synthesizers Already? What is My Problem Then?

#### I believe it's just that I'm a stubborn blind!

Have you ever heard of Accessibility?
If not, then most probably you don't have any kind of physical disability,
or you don't know anyone who have and stumbles upon this term.
Whether you have heard or not, let me explain anyway.
Accessibility, at the date of writing this README, is the ability of, for some reason, people with disabilities to access technologies
(computers, smartphones, operating systems, apps, websites, etc.).
I'm talking here about Accessibility in Tech.
I would say that the coverage of accessibility has been improved recently as there's some hype around it.

### Still, what's my problem?

#### The Problem is That I'm a User not an Accessor!

Say, for example, that you are forced to live in a house that is designed to be entered only from the roof.
So, everytime you enter or exit the house, you have to climb a ladder that takes you to the roof,
then you take the stairs from the roof down to the living area, and vice versa.
Meaning that you have access to the house,
but it doesm't sound so convenient to live in such a house.
This is exactly how I feel about the current level of accessibility to technologies; accessible but far from being usable.
